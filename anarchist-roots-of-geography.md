## Reading: The Anarchist Roots of Geography

[The Anarchist Roots of Geography, by Simon Springer, University of Minnesota Press, 2016.](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-anarchist-roots-of-geography)

This reads more like a history of anarchist thought than an analysis of anarchist geography per se, but the author argues frequently throughout that these are not clearly separable \(_"experimentation in and through space is the story of humanity's place on the planet."_\(p.3\)\). Key themes: Marxism vs Anarchism \(including a repetitive argument throughout that Marxism claims to be the only legitimate critique of mainstream liberal Geography\). Puts forward Elise Recluse \(universal geography, social ecology\) and Peter Kropotkin as the original radical geographers. Origins of anarchist thought and relationship to geography, role of the state, nature of revolution, relational and emancipatory space.

## Anarchism as more than just a rejection of the state. {#anarchismasmorethanjustarejectionofthestate}

References John Clark as contending that,_"the essence of anarchism is not simply opposition to the state itself but the practical and theoretical struggle against domination in all its groteque plurality."_\(p.67\). The_"only criteria is that \[it\] proceeds non-hierarchically and free from external authority."_\(p.71, referencing Graeber\). Geography's implicit relationship to the state through territoriality and spatial organization. An argument against revolution but instead for "insurrection" which enables an_"embrace of process and prefigurative politics"_\(p.68, throughout\), \(cf. Eugene Holland's "Slow Motion General Strike" \(Nomad Citizenship, ch. 4\) also argues that change can and should happen gradually from the inside. So do Hardt and Negri in their books\).

## Insurrection vs. Revolution {#insurrectionvsrevolution}

Revolution as fundamentally state-ist because it is in reaction to the state and formulated primarily as an attempt to overthrow it. The irony of overthrowing the state in order to establish a new one \(p.84\)._"What is imposed by force, has no roots and cannot last."_\(p. 87\).

Insurrection as a "revolution of the everyday," rising up and rejecting structures of domination simply by taking control of one's individual life \(p.84\)._"Direct action and insurrection are accordingly synonymous inasmuch as they reject any notion of vanguardism and invoke a prefigurative politics wherein the spectacular moment of revolution is replaced with the ongoing process of actually creating alternatives in the_here_and_now." \(p.84\).

_"If I leave the established, it is dead and passes into decay."_\(p. 84, quoting Max Stirner\). Anarchism, not as a symmetric resistance TO, but as a true 'other,' an alternative. Marxism as_producing_the state \(a new state\) rather than moving PAST the state._"Revolution is more than just the capture of the state; it exemplifies a totalizing spatial logic of Promethean impulse that seeks to remake everything according to a rational plan... Aside from the obvious authoritarianism of such a project, we should also recognize that not everything needs to be remade, and revolution is insensitive to the 'other worlds' and 'diverse economies' that already exist and are continually being remade through experimentation beyond capitalism."_\(p.88-89\)._**"Insurrection... consists of the voluntary assertion of autonomous self-arrangement so that one may immediately disengage from established discourses and structures, becoming emancipated from domination through a politics of refusal and the prefiguration of alternative."**_\(p.89\).

## Poststructuralism and Postanarchism {#poststructuralismandpostanarchism}

New forms of geography \(cf. related space? Doreen Massey\) as they relate to, or as a way of thinking about, non-state based politics \(p.62\). Anarchist geography offers not just alternative configurations of the state but alternatives TO the state \(p. 49\). But currently the field fails to incorporate new ideas in anarchist thinking that could offer more in this realm, eg. "Postanarchism." Postanarchism,_"... does not seek to move 'past' anarchism but instead rejects the epistemological foundations of 'classical' anarchist theories and their adherence to the essentialisms of the scientific method. Postanarchist thought accordingly seeks to reinvigorate anarchist critique by expanding its conception of domiantion from the state and capitalism to encompass the circuitous, overdetermined and multivariate networks that characterize contemporary power..."_\(p. 61\)

Anarchism as a historical precursor to poststructuralism: An_"unease with the utilitarianism and essentialism of Marxist though can similarly be regarded as a genesis of poststructralism... which instead focuses on the complexity and heterogeneity of our present condition and refuses totalizing theories through a rejection of absolute 'truths'."_\(p. 53\).

## Anarchism roots of and split with Marxism {#anarchismrootsofandsplitwithmarxism}

Godwin \(first to write about anarchism\), Proudhon \(Property as theft, first to explicitly refer to himself 'anarchist' as an ideology\), Bakunin \(contemporary to Proudhon, both involved with the Paris commune\), Kropotkin \(mutual aid 1902\), Goldman, bookchin \(very much inspired by Reclus\), Graeber.

Anarchism and Marxism as both fundamentally socialist ideologies. Anarchist contrasted with Marxist \(& communism\):_"... the desire to overturn the state and create a liberated socialist system via despotic power is a contradiction that anarchists disavowed."_\(p.50\). Shared origins and subsequent splintering over the role of the state p. 51, 74, 75, 80, and different beliefs in ends \(Marxism, state as utilitarian\) vs means \(anarchism\) \(p.72\). Anarchism provides a_"strategy of breaking the bonds of coercion and the chains of exploitation by encompassing an infinite number of everyday acts of resistance and cooperation."_\(p.73\). Mutual aid as everyday anarchism \(p.73\). Proudhon's writing as the origins of Marx's thought and reputation \(p.74-78\). The Paris Commune as having solidified differences in the two ideologies \(p. 79\). Marxist thought centering on class critique \(p.80\), hegemonic \(ironically\) in its analysis of oppression and proposal for a singular solution vs._"This line of critique reveals an additional sense of monopoly to which Marxism subscribes in the form of universalizing the proletariat and claiming such ontology as the egnine of emancipation for all of humanity"_\(p.81\), vs anarchist thought centering on autonomy and freedom from coercion/oppression in_all_forms._"Once we recognize multiple sites of oppression... the geographies of rebellion become much more diffuse than a single class-based revolution."_\(p.81\). Anarchism as a continuous everyday creation and struggle vs. the totalizing reinvention to something that is statically "better." Marxism \(with communism as its end-state\) as a_project_vs anarchism as a_process_\(p.90\).

## Public Space and Radical democracy {#publicspaceandradicaldemocracy}

Relational geographies as going beyond bounded territories of a single place where_"local contestations of public spaces can be read as a nodal point of interconnection in socially produced space"_\(p. 99, referencing Massey\), becoming_"moments tied to \[a\] broader assemblage,"_\(p.99\).

Aggregative and deliberative democracy as "antipolitical" "neoliberal rationalities" that "license hierarchical structures." \(ouch\) \(p.99-100\). "We might accordingly relabel the oxymoron 'representative democracy' as 'electoral authoritarianism." \(p.102\).
