De Witt Douglas Kilgore.
2003.


## intro:

What is this thing, Astrofuturism? Astrofuturism is "the tradition of speculative fiction
and science writing inaugurated by scientists and science popularizers
during the space race of the 1950s." elsewhere, it's also presented as a
"social movement and a mode of literary expression."

Kilgore argues for the need for astrofuturism by observing that "scholars of rocketry and spaceflight... have
recorded the development of missile technology and space science (p. 6)... and in
recent years there have been several studies... [that implicitly situate the
space era in its western sociopolitical context?]... [but] **to date, scholars have
not yet attempted detailed analysis of the narratives produced by the
spaceflight movement** (p.  7)... my approach is to bring [scientists and
writers] center stage and to **ask sometimes difficult questions about the
political solutions they propose in all sincerity as they pursue their goals**
(emphasis mine) (p. 7)

i'm interested in the utility of drawing the boundary where he does (1950s
space flight). i can see that there is utility to drawing a line _somewhere_,
but i wonder if this particular line serves more to validate
the author's hypothesis rather than surface any deeper truth? if we
drew the line elsewhere, would the overarching narrative (narrative about space
narratives) look different?

sometimes naming something does buy us the permission to engage with a critique. as the author says, the 1950s is
when space became a part of "America's dream of its future." (p.1). it's also
when the possibility of space became technically real. these are two legitimately important inflection
points in the history of space exploration.

"i want to interrogate mainstream astrofuturism to see how it answers the
**undeniable evidence of its complicity in the injustices of this world** and
attempts to rescue its goals for new political realities." (p.29). <-- THIS.

"vocabularies of aspiration" (p. 29) - nice phrase.

"i maintain that science must engage familiar aesthetic conventions and
legitimizing narratives to make its knowledge attractive to the lay public."
(p. 8). this argument is essentially what gets fleshed out in chapters 1 and 2.
the author argues how german rocket engineers played to the mainstream american
ideals of the age in order to be accepted, and that this in turn shaped the
nature of the space narrative.

- role of fan culture, media fandom
- star trek
- the white maleness of the vision of space futures contrasted with the
  emancipatory role space played for people who were not part of that group -
  from poor white kids to marginalized races. what does this say about it?

## chapter 1:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

space as emancipation (utopia) vs nationalism and colonization.

in the 1930s a bunch of engineers involved with amateur rocketry started the
American Interplanetary Society, a non profit that advocated for space travel.
Many of these same engineers were editors for a pulp fiction magazine called
the Wonder Stories, which is credited with being at the forefront of a "new
literature"-- science fiction (p.32). 

"Lasser and his colleagues were intent on
producing a literature that would participate in furthering scientific
knowledge and shaping technological advances." (p.34). they championed an
"exotic technological utopianism that addressed familiar histories and ordinary
hopes." (p.33) (though, frederic jameson (archaeologies of the future) argues
that the origins of sci fi came from the emergence of socialism in russia and
the dialectic that that produced for people-- a new idea that the future could
be different in ways we had not yet contemplated. thus: science fiction and
speculative fiction  were born.)

situated as they were in the depression, the editors of wonder stories used it
as an outlet to explore desires for political and social reform. through their
work on the wonder stories, Lasser and others realized that the idea of space
travel was actually possible, and began to advocate for it in earnest (hence
starting the AIS). although space had always represented the archetypal
utopia-- the unreachable nowhere across the horizon, the "other"-- now it
became a place to consider what might _actually_ be possible.

"spaceflight offers political hope, because it borrows the scientific ideal of
cooperation." (p.40). spacefight was imagined as a unifying venture that would
bring together all of humanity. Lasser's lens on space was largely one of
"democratic socialism and progressive scientific positivism." (p.41) "As an
extension of scientific exploration, the conquest of space will illuminate the
provinciality of nationalist ambitions and the racial divisions they require."
(p.41)

Lasser spent most of his career outside the Wonder Stories working as an
activist and policy advisor. He was an adovcate for workers rights and the
unemployed, and at some point he writes to Arthur C Clarke that, "As the impact
of large scale unemployment... became more powerful, I decided solving our
domestic Earthly problems had to come first." (p.41) Ouch! This seems like quite a
loss to the space movement, as someone positioned by the author as an
original source of sociopolitical vision for space-- and one that was
unifying and emancipatory.

Lasser got involved more heavily in politics and the New Deal. He was invited
to be a consultant to the Roosevelt administration, but his name came to the
attention of one of the McCarthyist smear committees. Although he was now more
of a mainstream liberal, the committee claimed he had past affiliations with
communist front organizations, "technocrocy" (looked down upon) and
"Furthermore, as illustrative of marked tendency toward one form of mental
aberration or another, Lasser was president of the Interplanetary Travel
Association." (gasp) (p. 46). An actual appropriations bill was passed with the
language that "no money could be expended by the WPA to pay the wages of one
David Lasser." (p. 47)

the real significance of this episode, the author suggests, is that "[w]hile
Lasser's political affiliation with communists may have been the immediate
cause of this episode, his early attraction to the political hopes represented
by space travel and technocracy tipped the scales against him... [because] the
political atmosphere or the 1940s and 1950s **discouraged any visible link
between Lasser's political progressivism and the military industrial complex
that would make his conquest of space possible.**" (p. 47, emphasis mine) 

this presents as a major fork in the narrative around space travel. As
developed in the following chapter, Kilgore argues that German rocket
engineers would **appeal to nationalist ambitions to sell the dream of space in
a way that the "idealist new dealer" could not** (p.47). 

is Lasser the origin of the term "common heritage"? (p.47)

## chapter 2:

early 20th century space enthusiasm was rooted in idealism, but the second
world war parlayed that into a narrative of conquest, winning, and domination. 

rather than the utopian framing of possibility and opportunity-- qualities which also
involve change-- after world war II people were looking for stability and reassurance that the
world order _wouldn't_ change, that space would represent an extension of the
familiar, an anchoring in, not upheaval. this is my extrapolation from chapter 1. but chapter 2 
reinforces this lens with the argument that the scientists and
engineers involved with the development of rockets had blood on their hands
after world war II and were in a sense looking for absolution. so it was they who 
leaned in most strongly to the space narrative. As German expatriates with
dark pasts, with that ferver came an undertone of nationalism and competition
that was in some senses an unspoken contract of their acceptance into American
society. As Chelsea says, "World War II has a lot to answer for."


## Literature role, critical perspectives and space futures

* "An investigation of the ideals and conflicts evident in America's dream of its future." P. 1
* astrofuturism as "a social movent and a mode of literary expression" p. 5
* "I want to interrogate mainstream astrofuturism to see how it answers undeniable evidence of its complicity in the injustices of this world and attempts to rescue it's goals for new political realities." p. 29
* grasping the tools of dominant culture and using "vocabularies of aspiration" as those excluded "voice our dissent from the restrictions placed on its promises." p. 29
* "at stake for me is the shape of the future: whether or not we can imagine, in any meaningful way, a future that both reflects and influences the complex realities of a complex world." p. 29
* "in... Proto-astrofuturism the rocket and other technologies of spaceflight authorize the literary imagination, literature in turn makes that science culturally viable." p. 40 (would be true of literature in general!)

## Tension: space as the great utopian unifier vs. space as conquest and domination, and legitimization of the American project  
* broad argument that Lasser was an influential figure who shaped the early narrative about space in the 1930s through his role in space advocacy (American Interplanetary Society) and science fiction (wonder stories). It was a vision of a "common human destiny" that was "stable throughout Lasser's political career." p. 47. 
* Lasser's investment in space travel's utopian potential is informed by his background as the child of immigrants and his commitment to a politically active scientism." p. 38
* Lasser presents "space travel as a variety of political reform realizable in this world... [He] hopes to popularize a science that could change human relationships..." p. 39. 
* "At the height of its influence, rocketry and the space programs associated with it became instruments for the projection of crude national ambitions. But thirty years before its involvement in cold war realpolitik, Lasser imagined space travel as an international venture directed by an International Interplanetary Commission headquartered in the Swiss Alps." p. 40. 
* "spaceflight offers political hope because it borrows the ideal of scientific cooperation... In Lasser's future, the great reward of space exploration is the extension of human knowledge instead of national prestige." p. 40. 
* for Lasser, there was a link between democratic socialism and progressive scientific positivism. In his book Conquest of Space, one of the explorer characters writes "we cannot but feel now that this journey has served its propose in breaking down of racial jealousies. All nations have United in a communion of joy... We realize now the fill making of Einstein's 'cosmic religion." p. 41, referring to Einstein's 1930 article on Religion and Science. 
* "The conquest of space will illuminate the provonciality of nationalist ambitions and the racial divisions they require." p. 40 
* Lasser, talking about the potential of spaceflight in 1957/58: "We may so establish the idea of the common heritage and common destiny that we share, that we can in time overcome the things that separate us." p. 47. 
* so it's not necessarily that this was the dominant or only narrative- but that it was a significant one that was underlying much of the popular and science fiction work on that time. 
* curious how widespread this idealistic/utopian narrative actually was. 
* see p. 78 for quotes on American approach. 

## Ch. 5 notes
* O'Neill's vision as a literary extension of new deal suburbanism and escapism. an extension of American values of pluralism instead of narrative of abandonment. Not utopian (other) but familiar (family values and green pastures).  
 * Space as an answer to the "limits to growth" debate. 
 * From conquest of space to what O'Neill calls the humanization of space.
* Conquest, nationalism, states, frontierism. 
* Complicated notions of the frontier in/as human progress. (p. 165)

* the desire to anchor in sociopolitical progress vs the vision of experimentation and diversity and freedom availed by the space frontier. "tension between a desire for genuine political alternatives and resistance to prescribing the nature of those alternatives."(p. 169).    Resistance or abdication? Willingness to prescribe or at least suggest technical solutions but not social ones. Why? "For O'Neill, freedom is guaranteed by machines and space, not by human desire or practice." p. 171). 

* related but distinct point: The fundamental tension between space envisioned as a site of diversity and experimentation, and the conformism, homogeneity (unity?) and mass mobilization necessary to get there. Especially in O'Neill's vision which is rooted in conformist suburbanism and therefore undermines the promise of diversity and experimentation (p. 156). How, or can, the extension of industrial civilization also act as a societal valve to release pressure towards uniformity (p. 167)? 

* if diversity IS achieved, then paradoxically it seems as though it is created through "locally intolerant monocultures." Does this have to be the case? Political differences "not resolved, but escaped." cf. New deal suburbanism). p. 169. 

* the "steady state society" (p. 159)- possible? Or must we assume growth of ideas and knowledge?
* O'Neill: humanization of the vision, social future not just conquest, democratic instead of militaristic, accessible, answer to overconsumption, limits to growth via resources of the sun, Moon and asteroids, answer to the left and desire for diversity through narrative of experimentation.
