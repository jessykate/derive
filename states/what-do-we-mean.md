# Exploring the Post nation

What do we mean by “post-geographic nation state”? What do we actually want to question or interrogate?

There are countless political theories that are anti- or post-statist, including the vast majority of non-/post-capitalist political theories: anarchism \(traditionally anti-state, not exclusive of a 'post' state mentality\) and marxism/communism \(the 'withering away' of the state\).

Are we interested in the nation state as distinct from the state? For me it's both-- the state is the political structure, and the notion of the 'nation' is a unifying factor or glue that motivates and reinforces the state. The nationality \(identity\) associated with statehood can be used to motivate allegiances, but may also be the mechanism through which change weaves its way into existing structures of the state, like trees growing through concrete. I am interested in exploring the waynationalidentity production is influencing and changing conceptions and expectations of the state.

Are we really sayingpost-state? Whether we see a future that is 'post-state' or simply 'new-state' is actually not so obvious... as a cohering collectivization structure that leverages group dynamics, it's probably unlikely that state-ish structures will go away. But more precisely, I associate the \[nation-\]state with features such as:

1. the provision ofservices, historically rooted in security, but with a growing purview of activities \(deep layers of policies around the nuances of achieving primary defensive goals and increasingly moving into affirmative areas of thriving\). Historically it made sense that we would would choose governments \(service providers\) close to us physically, if we could choose them at all, which of course we couldn't really.

2. a 'top level' political entity, subsumed by no other - as an entity it considers itself to havesovereigntyand autonomy.

3. monopoly on violence/ability to compel/a right of coercion\(even if it's not used, arguably the 'right' isitselfa coercion\)

4. * this includes the right to compel others to respect its autonomy and sovereignty.
5. usually one, but sometimes more,geographic domain\(s\) \(more == the federation of spain, or the netherlands, or island nations, etc.\)

6. * as opposed to, for example, a domain of power/rights defined primarily by the nature of the interaction, or the sphere of ...

if these are the features of the state \(are they?\), some ways we may see them change:

1. services- what we have historically looked to a single state for, could be spread across multiple entities \(colloquially it would seem inappropriate for a state today to offer less than a certain "minimum viable" set of services, and marginal states are often criticized and discussed on this topic. examples...\).

2. sovereigntyand autonomy - this quality actually mightnotchange, but could manifest very differently if the other features were different \(eg. conceptions of the state that target a specific set of services, often across arbitrary geographic areas \(strata-states?\)/non-predominantly-geographic states, etc.\). i think people are still looking for the quality of autonomy and sovereignty in states, even as their desired services and delivery architecture are changing.

3. right of coercion- i could see this going away internally. is this possible while still asserting sovereignty externally? Governance could evolve to be a reciprocal relationship, one of consent.

4. geography- see above. strata states.

## Why this change?

If \(if\) we accept the thesis of national identity as imagined community, then a contemporary thesis is that HOW we "imagine community" is changing: the sources of inspiration \(imagination\) are changing, and the tools for doing so are changing. The Strata-states are a re-articulation of imagined communities into “chosencomunities.” \(Cf. Assemblage theory\)

One factor is globalization or internationalization. Forging identities -- national identities?-- with people and values and ideals far away geographically. We are seeing...

1. a fundamental rearticulation of association, bonds of affinity and affiliation over familial and circumstantial bonds. de-emphasis on geographic affiliation as dominant.

2. tools to coordinate effectively across radically new domains \(and new domains to apply them to-- digital space\).

3. drastically less reliance on proximity for meeting one's needs. drastically easier to move - cheaper, less dangerous. less beholden to place. less compulsion to subrogate

## Reflections

Anderson makes the point that national identity production is about combining the ethereal with the specific. It's not just about creating an aspirational vision and labeling it a state, it needs to be tied to a day to day experience. He notes the parish priest was a “direct intermediary between his parishioners and the divine. \[A\] juxtaposition of the cosmic-universal and the mundane-particular… However vast Christendom might be, and was sensed to be, it manifested itselfvariouslyto particular Swabian or Andalusian communities as replications of themselves.”\(p. 23\).

But there are many aspirational/visionary membership groups. 1. When does membership transition to a national identity? And 2. Is \(a\) national identity enough to support the existence of a state?

Re 1. Maybe it's when that membership contains foundational-"enough" shared values, a vision based on those values \(actually-- I'm not sure a nation technically requires a vision beyond values?\) and also when there's enough infrastructure and/or norms around that vision for it to touch your everyday life. \(Why are the Kurds a nation?\)

in addition to understanding these dynamics \(for example, to spur them along\) it might be worth getting ahead of them and thinking about what the downsides will be, and what sort of 'constitutional' elements we would want of such strata-states?

Considered through negative contemporary associations with "nationalism" and "nationalists," are the strata-state just a new form of nationalism? The ability to associate only with those similar to us? The hipster nation?

Recognizing that these observations are predominently features of the "northern," relatively privileged classes. I am not arguing it's generic, I am arguing it's a beachead.

## Questions

* What do we look to the state for?

* * historically, physical security as a start. A monopoly over Jurisdiction. Or is that true? Its my assumption anyway.
* What actually is the relationship between the state and national identity?

* Less about the politics of nationalism and more about the philosophy of national identity

* If the "nation state" is a state united or defined in some significant way by a national identity, then how important is nation-ness to the modern state?

* What of citizenship?

* Production of digital space, it as a target of and opportunity to assert new policies.

* Native American tribes vs nations?

* What are the mostcontemporarynational identities? How have they emerged?

* Concepts of digital nations as a reference point?

* Estonian plans for digital backup. What happens if they get invaded? \(They become just another stateless nation?\)

* How is the production of national identity changing?

* * Politics of national identity/identity politics+ nationalism

  * IS national identity production changing?I have a hunch that it is… but are there examples and indicators that its production is changing? \(thanks @anika!\)
