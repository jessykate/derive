## Notes on the introduction chapter: Copernicus and the Savages

* "When there is neither coercion or violence, is it impossible to speak of power?" (P. 11)
* "A vast constellation of societies in which the holders o  f what elsewhere would be called power are without power; where the political is determined as a domain beyond coercion and violence, beyond hierarchical subordination; where, in a word, no relationship of command-obedience is in force." (P. 11-12)
* Is this a question of semantics about the definition of the existence of political systems? 
* historically, anthropologists considered these societies "pre political"
* but if that's the case then we have to explain their political (social/organizational) structures some other way, or, we have to deny that these social/political structures exist. If neither if these are true, then maybe they're not pre-political. 
* Quote P. 16
* any definition of power has to also relate to that which is non power
* if everything is political then it's not a super useful definition. 
* so part of the goal is to have a definition that is useful, and to figure out what that is. 
* quote bottom P.21
* Clastres thinks it is impossible to speak of societies without political power. "It is our view... That political power is universal, immanent to social reality." (p. 22)
* interesting hypothesis (p. 23) that the coercive form of political power "develops the more readily as social innovation becomes more important, its rhythm more intense, its scope more wide ranging."
* "in other words, social innovation is perhaps the basis of coercive political power, but is certainly not the basis of non-coercive power." And "innovation is therefore the basis of coercion, not the political." (!!)
* so does he have a better definition of power? "We shall go no further than to reject what ethnocentrists take for granted: that the bounds of power are set by coercion, beyond which and short of which no power could exist. In fact, power exists... Totally separate from violence and apart from hierarchy." (p. 22) the quoted passage continues "consequently, all societies, whether archaic or not political." I'm not sure I get the "consequently"?

So:
* Clastres wants to find the basis of non coercive power. More specifically:
  * why is there such a thing as political power?
  * why is there political power rather than nothing?
* "we do not claim to furnish the answer; our aim has been merely to state why previous answers are unsatisfactory and on what conditions a correct answer is possible... " This results in "two major lines of inquiry: **(1) what is political power? That is: what is society? (2) what explains the transition from non-coercive political power to coercive political power, and how does the transition come about? That is: what is history?"** (p. 24)
  * So... History begins when coercive power comes into play? Is this because (he postulates that) coercive power is correlated with (social) innovation, without which we have no change and therefore no history?
* "what was the first motor of social change? Perhaps we should look for it in the very thing that in archaic societies is concealed from our gaze, _in the political itself_." (p. 25). He continues, "it this would be necessary to return to Durkheim's idea... According to which political power presupposes social differentiation: might it not be political power that constitutes society's absolute difference? Could that not be the radical fissure at the root of the social, the initial break on which all movement and history depend, the primal splitting at the core of all differences?"
  * Absolute difference from what? From non-society? He has already proposed that, so I guess is just restating it more formally here? And also taking it further: saying it is not just correlation but causation. The emergence of politics is the lynchpin for the emergence of society. 
 * "A Copernican revolution is at stake... A complete reversal of perspectives is necessary."


LOVE: 
* Structure of the argument.
* how it takes your from thinking this is "just" a semantic argument to showing how those semantics can fundamentally alter our realm of inquiry and analysis. 

Things to prove:
* Why it's useful to incorporate new forms of power into the definition vs call it something else
* if it's really the case that we cannot have society without politics (that all societies are political). This makes some intuitive sense to me but I hope it gets fleshed out. 
*  innovation is the basis of coercion (referring also to Lapierre's book, which forms a motivating reference for Clastres' book)
* the equating of politics and power. An alternative would be to define politics as involving both power and non-power. Does it matter if we redefine politics or redefine power?

**Base argument:** that you cannot have society without the political. But our thinking about politics assumes it is hierarchical and coercive. This excludes a meaningful analysis of societies that don't exhibit these traits. Therefore our conception of the political has to be rethought to account for societies which do not exhibit traditional coercive forms of politics. 
  * --> Is this then equating the political with power? On p. 23: "...the social cannot be conceived without the political. In other words, there are no societies without power." This is a clear equation. 

Re: Coercion & Innovation...: Can you innovate without coercive power? Cf. Companies, culture and governance.
Non coercive power pre-dates coercive power?
