# Colonies

Most studies about space are actually a bit dry. They're political documents that make sure to include all the right partners
and carefully avoid prioritizing one actor over another or anchoring in any dates. 

I was really interested in where the key technical ideas about space settlement originated from. The ones with soul, not 
rubber stamps. The equivalent of "opinionated frameworks:" proposals with teeth that are strongly about why to do things a 
certain way. 

The most recent significant effort of the "opinionated" type, and sadly _still_ the canonical work about space colonization 
in this generation, is probably [Gerard O'Neill's The High Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Frontier:_Human_Colonies_in_Space).

O'Neill's book is kind of like a physicist raving madly without a blackboard. He comes at it from first principles, 
using order of magnitude estimates to sketch out the problem, but doesn't formalize any of them and rarely states where 
his assumptions come from. It's impassionated and I can see why people find if enticing, but is not that satisfying as 
a foundational text.

The High Frontier was actually just one of several works that emerged from an interest group that met over several 
years in the in the mid 1970s. Started by O'Neill to inspire physics students, there was a set of key meetings at Princeton, 
a NASA Ames Summer Institute that did significant work on the topic, numerous papers, testimonies to congress, and initiatives 
like the Space Studies Institute that came out of it. I think the community around it is very telling. It comes across as a 
feverish and defining collaboration for many of the folks involved.

I found the book "[Colonies in space](http://www.nss.org/settlement/ColoniesInSpace/index.html)," written by another 
individual from this group and published at almost the exact same time, a more comprehensive and technical discussion 
of the motivations and designs behind orbiting colonies, with links to numerous 
technical references. It's like an annotated bibliography that is itself a book. My impression is that 
the references in this book are foundational 'modern' technical works in space colonization. While much has changed in 
the basic sciences (in materials science, computing, robotics, propulsion... pretty much everything), not a lot of work has 
directly built on (or upended) the reasoning behind the basic concepts or systems designs (it probably should).  

The vision of orbiting space colonies had a clear motivation - population is going to grow, humanity will need more room, 
resources, and physical space to support the greater diversity that will inevitably come along with this. Settlements 
provide this space, and to make them viable we'll need an economic model. Solar power is that economic model. This pretty 
much sets the stage for everything that follows-- orbiting live-work colonies, lunar mining, mass drivers, transportation 
systems, etc.
