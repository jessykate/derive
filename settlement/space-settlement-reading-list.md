* [Krafft Arnold Ehricke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafft_Arnold_Ehricke). _"In 1948, while working for the U.S. Army, Ehricke wrote a story about a manned mission to Mars called "Expedition Ares". It anticipated the many challenges that still face explorers who will make the journey in the future. In the same year he wrote a book with Wernher von Braun, The Mars Project, which detailed how man could travel to Mars using a ferry system."_
