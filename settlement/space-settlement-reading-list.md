# Space Settlement Reading List

WIP. 

Technical proposals and architectures, conceptual realizations and narratives of human settlement of space. These range from compelling science fiction to settlement architectures from government agencies and informed experts, to design documents and trade spaces for specific mission components.  

Works should be of some note, whether due to impact, longevity or infamy. 

## Overviews, Architectures and Development proposals

1. [Colonization of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon), Wikipedia page.
1. [The High Frontier,](https://archive.org/details/highfrontierhuma00onei) Human Colonies in Space. Gerard ONeill, 1978. 
1. [Krafft Arnold Ehricke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafft_Arnold_Ehricke). _"In 1948, while working for the U.S. Army, Ehricke wrote a story about a manned mission to Mars called "Expedition Ares". It anticipated the many challenges that still face explorers who will make the journey in the future. In the same year he wrote a book with Wernher von Braun, The Mars Project, which detailed how man could travel to Mars using a ferry system."_
