# Architectures, Roadmaps, Studies

Technical proposals and architectures, conceptual realizations and narratives of human settlement of space. These range from compelling science fiction to settlement architectures from government agencies and informed experts, to design documents and trade spaces for specific mission components.  

## Lunar Settlement

* [Colonization of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon), Wikipedia page.
* [Project Horizon,](https://history.army.mil/html/faq/horizon.html) Proposal to Establish a Lunar Outpost. US Army Report, 1959. 
* [Lunar Bases and Space Activities of the 21st Century,](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/) Wendel Mendell, 1985. 
* NASA Technical Report: [Space Technology to Meet Future Needs.](https://archive.org/details/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19880001437) 1987. _"Key technologies were identified where contemporary investments might have large payoffs in technological options for the future. The future needs were considered for space transportation, space science, national security, and manned missions."_ 
* [NASA Capability Roadmap](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050204002.pdf), 2005, Executive Summary (still ~330 pages). _"a summary of the capabilities necessary to execute the Vision for Space Exploration and the key architecture decisions that drive the direction for those capabilities."_ From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization): _"In October 2004, NASAâ€™s Advanced Planning and Integration Office commissioned an ISRU capability roadmap team. The team's report, along with those of 14 other capability roadmap teams, were published May 22, 2005.[47] The report identifies seven ISRU capabilities:[47]:278 (i) resource extraction, (ii) material handling and transport, (iii) resource processing, (iv) surface manufacturing with in situ resources, (v) surface construction, (vi) surface ISRU product and consumable storage and distribution, and (vii) ISRU unique development and certification capabilities. The report focuses on lunar and martian environments. It offers a detailed timeline[47]:274 and capability roadmap to 2040[47]:280-281 but it assumes lunar landers in 2010 and 2012."_

## Mars 
I'm not really studying Mars at the moment but these are some key studies, iconic references, and cultural or intellectual curiosities: 

* [Krafft Arnold Ehricke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafft_Arnold_Ehricke). _"In 1948, while working for the U.S. Army, Ehricke wrote a story about a manned mission to Mars called "Expedition Ares". It anticipated the many challenges that still face explorers who will make the journey in the future. In the same year he wrote a book with Wernher von Braun, The Mars Project, which detailed how man could travel to Mars using a ferry system."_

* [Eyes on the Red Planet, Human Mars Mission Planning 1952-1970](https://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/CR-2001-208928.pdf). 
* The Case for Mars, Robert Zubrin, 1996 (updated 2011)
* Red Mars/Green Mars/Blue Mars. 
* [Project Mars, a Technical Tale](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Mars-Technical-Wernher-2006-10-20/dp/B01HC9EN4K?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01HC9EN4K), 2006, Werner Von Braun. _"Von Braun's unpublished science fiction novel from 1948 was eventually published in Canada by Apogee Books in December 2006 as Project Mars: A Technical Tale. It included his technical papers on the proposed project and paintings by Chesley Bonestell.[3][7] This version included updated mathematics by Earnest Willhite and was edited by retired US Space and Rocket Center archivist Irene Willhite."_ ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Project#cite_ref-vonBraun-2006_7-0)) (see also [apogee books' description](http://www.cgpublishing.com/Books/ProjectMars.html))
