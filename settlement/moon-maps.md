# Moon maps

I would like to make a small printed book with different maps of the Moon. 

## Landing sites

## Illumation maps
Light and dark, peaks of eternal light

see also [this delightful image](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/993) of the rim of shackleton crater, which is the closest to a real "peak of eternal light" (90% sunlit)
and a [nice overview](https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/new-light-on-the-lunar-poles-156800678/) of the "eternal light" phenomenon by Spudis)

## Water

More of these gems from [USGS](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/usgs/index.shtml)

## Elevation Map
from [GRAIL maps 2012](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4014))

## Gravity map
(Not sure this is very evocative)
