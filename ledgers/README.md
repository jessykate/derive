Ledgers, Money and Accounting

Money can be used as...
1. store of value (eg. this coin or cow is actually something directly of value to me)
2. medium of exchange (eg. a share or a ledger that records what one person owes)
3. unit of account

But _ledgers_ and _accounting_ are much more general concepts. They are also used for:

1. ownership (who owns what portion or share)
3. representation (who has a right to participate in decisions)
2. governance (what constitues agreement)

Ledgers and accounting are made possible in radically new ways by blockchain technology. Blockchains allows for the dynamic and easy (if you are a technologist) creation of reliable (trusted/trustable) ledgers. Through the derivative concept of smart contracts (also stored on a blockchain), these ledgers can encode agreements in ways that open up a greenfield for law and social institutions writ large. 

For these reasons:

* blockchain and cryptocurrencies are often conflated with governance. They are of course related through the above, but not the same. 
* there is a surge in excitement and fascination around governance, decision making and law (which is great), but most of that enthusiasm is being poured into the accounting mechanisms, rather than the actual design and facilitation of decision making. This certainly makes some sense-- one is technical and quantitative, and thus easier to chip away at. The other is qualitative, subjective and often quite elusive.  

I'm interested in the intersection.
