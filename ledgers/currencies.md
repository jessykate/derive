# Currencies and Tokens

## When and why

*Specialized* currencies meaning currencies launched to support/catalyze a project \(or blockchains used for internal/private use/tracking? or is that a different category?\), as opposed to more general-use currencies meant to be maximally fungible as aspirational substitutes for fiat currencies.

Someone is launching a new currency.

Why launch a whole currency for a new project? How does this relate to traditional alternatives such as bootstrapping, consultstrapping, traditional equity investment, traditional loans, etc.?

What does it mean when someone launches a currency around a project? If you buy some, what kind of statement are you making ? what will you do with it? how do you know if it was a good purchase?

## Currencies vs. Tokens and Coins

* people could be launching a token or coin to represent some agreement or value. it might not be meant as money per se. think of airline miles or a store credit. these are not generally considered "money" \(because they are not fungible\) but they represent some store of value, a future credit you can redeem.

## ICOs

* an ICO offers basically a crypto-stock, that "represents ownership interest in an enterprise." \([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering)\).
* because it is implemented as a "coin" \(presumably a crypto-coin\), it offers features such as being unregulated, decentralizable \(in theory\), independently verifiable and all the other benefits of a blockchain based currency.
* however, is it stored on some _other_ blockchain for authenticity and verifiability? otherwise, aren't you just trusting the \(relatively small\) set of people who own the currency in question? dont you miss out on the distributed dynamics of a large block chain in that case?
* tokens can also be offered in an ICO, and are more like airline miles or pre-purchased access to some future product or service.

so why use an ICO \(for stock or token\) instead of some other way?

* stock purchases/sales are of course highly regulated.
* for tokens there may be an ease of management and ability to assert trustworthiness factor
* ability to be experimental in the management of these coins/tokens - eg. what behaviours are allowed, disallowed, rewarded, how ownership of the stock is governed, who can receive it, with whose input, how it can be traded, etc.
* the tokens/coins are fungible \(can be traded on an open market\), _to the extent that_ they are valuable to others. "Because these tokenized loyalty points are put onto a public blockchain, the points are not limited to being traded in exchange for services within the platform, but instead can be traded anywhere. If there is enough activity within a given ICO's environment, their tokens will become globally traded on the various exchanges that handle cryptocurrencies." \([ref](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanchester/2017/06/12/a-new-way-to-raise-money-the-initial-coin-offering/2/#1a165b07396c)\)
* of course if it's not that level of success, selling your crypto stock would more be like trying to sell any other privately held stock \(i guess...\)

use cases

* credit towards/promise of a future product or service of the enterprise
* ecosystem/platform plays
* rights to dividends and/or voting rights on an enterprise \(direct\)
* distributing ownership in new ways.
* rights to dividends and/or voting rights on an investment fund \(indirect\)
* decentralized applications like ethereum and storj, where use of the application is paid for in the currency \(like the first example\) AND, an application currency lets the application enforce protocols for using the service in a decentralized way, rather than relying on central control/enforcement and the whim of individuals. users can read smart contracts that outline the protocol and, in theory, trust that a computer will automatically execute on that contract in the way they understand.

cf. LETs systems and local neighbourhood "bucks," eg like berkeley bucks? these can scale arbitrarily but both provide an incentive to buy the product or service associated with the currency. also with the right technology these are easier to manage without personal trust or simply single point of failures. and they are also assets that can be profited on, not simply credits for future uses.

## Alt-coins for investment

## Private blockchains

* eg. banks, visa, large companies using private block chains. why? doesn't this eliminate the benefits of the blockchain? yes and no...

## eg...

* distributed ownership? comakery, colony.io, backfeed, mastly...
* swarm.fund
* the DAO
* ripple, stellar
* IPFS?
