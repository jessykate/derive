Social Impact and disruption

blockchains have neat features that are historically unprecedented. they are decentralized. private. secure. but crypto currencies dont _necessarily_ change the basic power dynamics around money, how we use it in society, who is able to get access to it, its conception as a scarce resource, or our basic economic system rooted in transactions and commodification. (footnote: mutual credit system and other conceptions of money...)

blockchain can also be used for dytopian/draconian purposes: like all technologies it is dual use.

blockchain is not _necessarily_ equated with emancipation or freedom, though it can be.
blockchains can be used for bad too

## private blockchains

private blockchains are a whole different ballgame
* governments
* banks
* ICOs/enterprises.

blockchains can store value/act as currencies, and they can store verifiable information (or both of course). these are really different use cases.

## social money systems and fintech

* LETS
* MC systems
* gift economy
* time banks
* savings pools
* ...

why don't we see more mashups between these worlds?
