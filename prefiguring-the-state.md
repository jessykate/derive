## Notes

* Alternative conceptions of the state 
* rather than dismiss the state, explore redefining it (do not "abandon the state to neoliberalism")
* use British radical municipalism as an example of ways to reimagine
* exploration of what prefiguration means, nice references. 
* focus on _conceptual_ prefiguration
* suggest BMR can be a reference for conceptually prefiguring alternatives to the current concept of the state [1]. 
* draw on "legal pluralism" to open up more plural ways of conceptualizing the state (nice references here too)
* legal pluralism presumed that more than one system of law (or 'normative ordering') exists in any social field. 
* could we have state pluralism too?
* this defines the state as less special, less "exceptional," and asks what happens when other forms of organizing are characterized as state-like activities. (Eg guerilla activities, local organizing as micro states)
* offers a "reading [of] local government in ways that foreground its state-enacting efforts" (p. 10)
* BMR qualities:
    * demonstrates how statehood can be claimed 
    * "Strong state pluralism"
    * "deliberate pursuit of policies that challenged the assumed scale and focus of municipal action"
* key Ways that BMR could prefigure different qualities of the state:
    1. Embedded - everyday practices, experimentation
    2. activist - "state readiness... to act deliberately and explicitly on behalf of marginal and subjugated interests" (p. 15)
    3. stewardly - a "deliberate pursuit of policies that challenge the assumed scale and focus of municipal action... BMR councils supported international struggles against oppression, colonialism and apartheid. They challenged the notion that peace and collective safety were beyond their domain of concern." "These measures generated a form of local governance we might read as rhizomatic." (p. 12).  "challenges the conventional territorial notion" of the state. What role does "bordering" have in prefigurative state thinking?
* Some concluding defenses of prefigurative conceptions
* critical vs prefigurative thinking about the state (this was not well delineated, nor necessarily mutually exclusive, IMHO) 
* notes that for neoliberalism, "reimagining the state and making a new imaginary hegemonic proved crucial" to it's expansion (p. 20). 
* concludes that "prefiguratively reimagining [the state] makes it possible to recognise micro, shadow, guerrilla, embryonic, dying, local, national, regional, and supranational states as *political* governing formations," (p.21) (emphasis mine)
* "as new kinds of political governance formations emerge, including at global and regional scale, radical politics needs to engage with the fantasy of what stateness could and should entail." (p.22) Yes!


[1] Not sure how this is methodologically different than just referencing it. If the argument is that we could use it as a basis for the possible (a kind of 'suspend disbelief' approach), then I'm not sure the essay carries the argument all the way through-- ie, it uses BMR to suggest ingredients for (conceptual) prefiguration but doesn't actually offer a conceptual prefiguration itself.
