## Notes  

This is sort of my interpretation rather than a very close summary. I found this hard to follow and am trying to identify a linear progression of reasoning. 

* so: democracy
* there is an assumption that only "the one" can rule
* sovereignty _requires_ that there exist a concept of the "one" - even if that "one" is a function of group action (like a democratic election or agreement on a single outcome). 
* but this undermines the concept of democracy - the one is not the many. 
* "there can be no politics without sovereignty" (p. 329)
* this is a "kind of blackmail" - a false alternative between "the one" and chaos. 
* sovereignty is actually two sided - the ruled and the rulers. 
* therefore there exist contradictions in the notion of sovereignty
* sovereignty means nothing without consent, and without the belief on the part of the ruled that there is something worth subjugating their freedom for. 
* but the ability to withdraw consent limits the sovereignty so claimed by "the one." (it is not sovereign if others have power over it). 
*  in the age of global empire, this balancing power of "the ruled" is more pronounced
* different forms of power and production are blurred (economic, social, etc.)
* in empire, capital and sovereignty overlap. 
* (...which makes empire more dependent on social production?)
* ... which gives the multitude more power
* new "skills" associated with networks and open commons production translate from economic production to social production and decision making. 
* so what does it mean for the multitude to make decisions?
* --> something like: open source
* therefore as the multitude gets stronger, sovereignty becomes unnecessary (argument is that since the multitude are the ruled, their increasing power over the rulers means that sovereignty is irrelevant. **but why?** if sovereignty involved an inherent tension, and that tension is what makes sovereignty meaningful because the ruled actually care about the subject of the sovereignty-- then multitude would _strengthen_ sovereignty.)
* "the multitude banishes sovereignty from politics." (p. 340)
* as the multitude gets stronger, and their reasons for consenting correspondingly weaker, those in power rely more on war, to coerce. 

* the multitude must resist. to practice democracy (which is finally made possible by the multitude), it will have to fight in some way. "the pharaoh does not let the jews flee in peace." (p.341). 
* what is a (legitimate) democratic use of force?
  * the pursuit of political goals
  * only in defense 
  * must be organized democratically. 
  * corollary: violence can only preserve what has already been created. it can never create something new.

* but we need a critique of arms, we need to invent new weapons for democracy today. 
* guns are not the right tool for these resistances, not the right tools for this fight. 

TLDR:
* multitude makes sovereignty irrelevant (disagree)
* it will change the way that democracy is practiced (agree)
* it will decenter current ruling parties. 
* the status quo rulers/those in power will not let the multitude go quietly into a new way of organizing.  
* we will need to develop new tools for resisting in this modern theatre of battle. (me: physical violence is not necessarily where it's at.)
* any violence used for resistance should be applied democratically (legitimately) 

other thoughts:
* i either don't follow or simply don't find this to be a good argument about sovereignty. it seems to be contradicting itself. 
* perhaps the strength of the ruled strengthens the "subject" of the sovereignty, motivates subjugation to a grader cause. 
* perhaps it changes the nature of sovereignty, not invalidates it. 
* also perhaps sovereignty can be subject to _internal_ coercion, just not external.
