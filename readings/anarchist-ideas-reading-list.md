A living list of anarchist writings. 

1. The Anarchist Roots of Geography, by Simon Springer 
2. Libertaran Socialism: politics in red and black, compares and contrasts marxism and anarchism.  (Zarinah is reading this right now, I haven't yet, but it looks like a nice analysis)
3. Murray Bookchin (the anarchist/municipalist/social ecologist who inspired Abdul Occalan's vision for Rojava. Two well known works are "Post-Scarcity Anarchism" (and in particular the chapter _A Liberatory Technology_ (1965!)) and "The Next revolution - Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy"
4. "Demanding the Impossible: A History of anarchism" (Peter Marshall). Several editions, one of those big reader type books. Perhaps the most systmatic of this list.
