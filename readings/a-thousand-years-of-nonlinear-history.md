## Overview

**The TLDR: Process generates structure.**

Ie. “process" can be taken as a primitive or atomic ingredient in analyzing the     dynamics of human systems. Think like a unit vector in algebra. Structures are everything that makes up human society - cities, organizations, trade routes, languages, etc.  In short, process is a primitive.

AFAIU, this is not actually Delanda’s idea, but D&G (largely in a book called A thousand plateaus) and at the heart of a philosophy called “new materialism.” I haven’t read A thousand plateau’s so don’t know exactly where they stop and where delanda picks up.

What Delanda does is apply the idea of "Structure Generating processes" (SGPs) to the narrative of the last thousand years, leveraging a variety of sources from complexity theory, biology, linguistics, and edgy socioeconomic theory to support his claim that the evolution of human society is not manifest, but rather generative and bottom up, emergent from the interplay of dynamics between these SGPs. Thus, “history" is the result of complex interactions between the processes of abstract machines, not a linear and deterministic progression: "the major transitions in early human history…[are not] a linear advance up the ladder of progress but a crossing of non linear critical thresholds (bifurcations).” (p.15). “in other words, human history did not follow a straight line, as if everything pointed toward civilized societies as humanity’s ultimate goal. on the contrary, at each bifurcation alternative stable states were possible, and once actualized, they co-existed and interacted with one another.” (p.16). “so it follows that a top-down analytical approach that begins with the whole and dissects it into its constituent parts… is bound to miss precisely those properties… that emerged from complex interactions.” (p.17).

So: again, process generates structure. De Landa’s book tries to convince us of this hypothesis by retelling history from this standpoint, and showing that the results are consistent with the changes we observe over time. He also suggests that a process-based philosophy of society means that the “notion of fittest design loses its meaning… no optimal solution… since the criterion of “fitness” itself changes with dynamics.” and that in such cases “a belief in the fixed criterion of optimality disappears…”.  In summary, “this book is an exploration of the possibilities that might be opened to philosophical reflection by a similar move in the social sciences.” (p. 14).

### Quick technical summary:
    Abstract machines are behind **structure-generating processes** (SGP). Structures are what we see and interact with, whereas abstract machines are kind of like the hidden markov variables of human society. Abstract machines have “engineering diagrams” which is essentially his way of saying that, like any machine, they are postulated to work in a consistent way; our job is to show that each “machine” with its specific and consistent set of internal dynamics, can generate a wide variety of observed phenomena.

i tried to make a list of the abstract machines and SGPs that he proposed, but it was quite hard to keep track of and i wasn’t always clear about what was what:

- process/operation: autocatalytic loops
    - stable states = “attractors” or “eigenstates"
    - these system evolve by “drift"
    - structures: meshworks
        - which are a more general class of “self-consistent aggregates"
- process/operation: sorting, homogenization, accumuluations (?), stratifications, calcification
    - structure: hierarchies
        - more general class of structures: stratified systems
- process: abstract probehead, searching device
    - replicators (cf. genetic replication) + sorting devices = abstract probehead?
    - structures = species, ecosytems, cultures,
- process/SGP = combinatorial constraints
    - replicators = ?
    - combinatorial constraints: operator-argument, likelihood, reduction
    - structures = strings (languages), group & grid?


## Discussion
At first I thought he was going to show that each SGP was independently sufficient to generate observed history, which was fascinating. Then I realized that each section of the book with its "middle chapters” introducing new structure generating processes, was kind of building off of each other. It wasn’t clear to me exactly how... Is each set of processes meant to be truly general, and applicable in all domains? If so why did he chose to highlight each one in a specific domain? Doesn’t that make it harder to see that SGP at work in other domains? And if they’re not applicable in all domains, then isn't that counter to his fundamental point that "abstract machines" have GENERAL structure-generating processes?

Eventually he refers to more “general" abstract machines (sorting, stratification, attractors) leading to more specific ones (p.263), but IMO he glosses over this, and seems to refer to it without explicitly discussing the idea as such.

Also: I was left wondering, could we not construct post-rationalizations of the evolution of society based on many other conceptualized abstract machines? Why not a circle, a spiral, a zigzag, a mandala? he shows that his approach is not INconsistent with history, but doesn’t show it is necessarily generative. ie, he is still using a reverse analysis with knowledge of where we have gotten to. the understandably hard part about this is that, based on the nature of his hypothesis, he can’t say “it necessarily WOULD have evolved this way” since his whole point is that it is not a destiny manifest. even most agent based approaches try and show that simple local rules converge on “the world as we know it” rather than “could also have converged on other worlds but might converge on this one.” so this is a really neat extension of generative methods in general (at least as far as i am familiar), but leaves me wondering what a “scientific proof” looks like in this realm.

I felt that the idea of replicators and probeheads were confusing - the concepts kind of made sense but were not obviously compelled by the evidence provided. ie, when he introduced them it was more confusing that clarifying, because it wasn’t really clear if or why they were *needed* to advance his proposal.

One thing De Landa doesn’t seem to get into is the question of where do such “processes" come from? And based on what criteria do we have reason to think these processes are more primitive than other things? (As i start to read de Landa’s book on assemblages, I can see that he tries to address this question there— not of where they come from but why they are primitive. Can report back :p). While we’re on the topic of questioning assumptions: we seem to generally think that simpler models are better. but isn’t there is an implicit value statement in that too? That “simple” is more “elegant” and somehow “better”? But why?

There are some pretty radical implications of his overall approach. I’ve been obsessed lately with this question about whether or not progress is isotropic, ie, do objective, well defined notions of progress actually exist? My interpretation from this book is that “progress" cannot possibly be well defined. Woah.

### non-linearity
non-linear usually means super or sub linear, but here he means something more like, “non two dimensional” or “not a function at all” in the sense that there is no such thing as a well defined progression over time (versus t), there is no thing that when plotted versus t would be linear (or moving consistently forward at all). of course, this *could* be constructed— eg. we could plot murder or lifespan or access to human rights or institutions or over time, so while i agree with him intuitively, i’m not sure he *proved* that history is definitely non-linear or non-progressing, only that one CAN see it differently and that such a narrative is ALSO consistent. ie, he did not falsify the counter argument IMHO. i wonder how one might...

## conclusion - 
i feel like he falls short on the question of “what should we do with this information,” and i would almost rather he hadn’t tried to conclude at all rather than meekly conclude something about politics. “This brings us to the question of the pragmatic uses of these ideas. the last three or four centuries have witnessed an intense homogenization of the world… a fact that in itself woulf seem to recommend the injection of a healthy dose of heterogeneity into the mix. Or, in the shorthand we have been using, the world has become so greatly stratified that the only way out is to destratify it.” the very next sentence then says, “there are several things wrong with this knee-jerk response.” and yet after saying why for 2 pages, his summary point is that “changing our way of way of thinking about the world is a necessary first step, but it is by no means sufficient. we will need destratisfy reality itself.”

if we agree with him, then these processes simply ARE happening and are defining the evolution of human systems over time. what do you want to do with it? what does it even mean to have an opinion about the state of and desired changes in human systems over time, if we can’t meaningfully talk about progress? should we just strive for what subjectively feels (relatively) “better” in the moment? on p. 255 talks about “guaranteeing social change in the direction of a fairer, less oppressive society” which suggests that minimally he does believe in subjective striving for better experience (which for him seems to mean “fairness” is a valuabale thing to strive for, as is minimizing “oppression” (which is not well defined objectively)).

for me, it might have been stronger to talk about something more radical like post-politics or post-meaning. even as just a parting provocation. “destratify reality” is a bit TOO pithy for me, and he never discusses WHY - why should we have an opinion at all on a structural level? even though we’re in a period dominated by hierarchies, given that we just tore down the very idea of linear history, why should we presume now that BALANCE is in any way fundamental? and won’t destratisfying reality just lead to more dynamics that will cause a new layer of sorting and homogenization, then calcification, then hierarchies to emerge?

or, perhaps he is saying that that’s the LEVEL at which we need to look at destratifying now - not at the systems level, because we’ve already done that. but if our goal us *understanding* then we need to go *deeper* with these same dynamics.

i think two quotes from a couple of pages back better capture this - the first is a quote from “a thousand plateuas” (p.272)

“you don’t reach the BwO, and its plane of consistency, by wildly destratifying… if you free it with too violent an action, if you blow apart the strata without taking precautions, then instead of drawing the plane you will be killed, plunged into a black hole, or even dragged towards catastrophe. Staying stratified - organized, signified, subjected- is not the worst that can happen; the worst that can happen is if you throw the strata into demented or suicidal collapse… This is how it should be done: lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an adantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continuums of intensities by segment, have a small plot of land at all times."

and then he goes on to say that “Thus the call for a more experimental attitude toward reality and for an increased awareness of the potential for self-organization inherent in even the humblest form of matter-energy."

(p.69 and conclusion - assumption that “balance” == “ethical”?)
