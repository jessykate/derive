# Anarchism, Postructuralism and the Future of Radical Politics

Saul Newman, 2007

* key elements of anarchist thought include
  * post-statist politics
  * post-party politics
  * a politics of emancipation
* modern continental thinkers have a lot in common with anarchist thinking yet they never mention it directly
  * ranciere, agamben, badiou, laclau...
* traditional anarchist thought is very "humanist" and "positivist"
  * by which i take it means the human is at the center, and that it affirms or asserts certain inherent traits of these humans.  
* but poststructuralism suggests certain ontological updates need to be made to anarchist thinking
  * incorporation of the contingent, the unpredictable, the dynamic[^1]

  * critiques "essentialist" identities
