## Notes

* key elements of anarchist thought include
  * post-statist politics
  * post-party politics
  * a politics of emancipation
* modern continental thinkers have a lot in common with these key components of anarchist thinking yet they never mention it directly
  * ranciere, agamben, badiou, laclau...
* traditional anarchist thought is "humanist" and "positivist"
  * by which i take it is meant, the human is at the center, and that it affirms or asserts certain inherent traits of these humans.
* but poststructuralism suggests certain epistemological updates need to be made to anarchist thinking
  * incorporation of the contingent[^1], the unpredictable, the dynamic
  * critiques "essentialist" identities \(eg. class as the primary identity around which emancipation should be pursued\)
* this is post-anarchist, "an ethics of anti-authoritarian egalitarianism," "embraces contingency and indeterminacy and rejects essentialist identities and firm ontological foundations."
  * this is not nihilism, it is a deeper emancipation from the very notion or authority itself of a specific way of thinking about things
  * in this way both the enlightenment and anarchism seek the freedom and autonomy to question everything 
* a post-anarchist theory needs to rethink universality and sovereignty \(why does it _need_ to?\).
  * we need new forms of sovereignty - "popular sovereignty" - a "force without power" \(Derrida\)
  * the nature of what is considered universal in this contingent future, and who decides what is universal, will very much be the site of political struggle.
  * post-anarchist universality must be something around which heterogeneous groups can mobilize
