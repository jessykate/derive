## Notes

* key elements of anarchist thought include
  * post-statist politics
  * post-party politics
  * a politics of emancipation
* modern continental thinkers have a lot in common with these key components of anarchist thinking yet they never mention it directly
  * ranciere, agamben, badiou, laclau...
* traditional anarchist thought is "humanist" and "positivist"
  * by which i take it is meant, the human is at the center, and that it affirms or asserts certain inherent traits of these humans.
* but poststructuralism suggests certain epistemological updates need to be made to anarchist thinking
  * incorporation of the contingent[^1], the unpredictable, the dynamic
  * critiques "essentialist" identities \(eg. class as the primary identity around which emancipation should be pursued\)
* this is post-anarchist, "an ethics of anti-authoritarian egalitarianism," "embraces contingency and indeterminacy and rejects essentialist identities and firm ontological foundations."
  * this is not nihilism, it is a deeper emancipation from the very notion or authority itself of a specific way of thinking about things
  * in this way both the enlightenment and anarchism seek the freedom and autonomy to question everything 
* a post-anarchist theory needs to rethink universality and sovereignty \(why does it _need_ to?\).
  * we need new forms of sovereignty - "popular sovereignty" - a "force without power" \(Derrida\)
  * the nature of what is considered universal in this contingent future, and who decides what is universal, will very much be the site of political struggle.
  * post-anarchist universality must be something around which heterogeneous groups can mobilize 
* at a time when we need new options, **"anarchism-- for so long overshadowed by Marxism-- can perhaps become the referent for a radical politics of the future." **



_"Contemporary radical politics is therefore a politics that avoids the forms of the state-- the seductive trap of state power that lay in wait for revolutionary movements in the past. It invents its own, non-institutional, decentralized forms of politics and mass participation that are not sanctioned by the state and that go beyond the formal parliamentary process. Implicit here is an anarchist style of politics that seeks not to take control of state power, but rather to create new, non-statist forms of communal association and direct democracy that would make the state irrelevant."_
