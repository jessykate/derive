## Notes

### author motivations

* community and social belonging are constellated as problems due to the "accelerating destabilization of the ideal nation state-- both internally \(increasing ethnic, religious, and cultural heterogeneity\) and externally \(decreasing sovereginty in the face of global interdependence and transnational capital\)" \(p. xxiii\)
* nation state is becoming obscolete, "other forms of allegiance and identity have taken its place."...
  _"key identities and identificationsnow only partially revolve around the realities and images of place."_
  \(p. xvii\) \(arjun appadurai\)

### chapters

affirmative nomadology  
death state  
nomad citizenship  
free market communism  
conclusion \(slow motion general strike\)  
appendix: a defense of so-called utopia projects? \(nomadologic and dialectic utopianism\) \(i would say here he contrasts nomadologic FROM dialectic utopianism\).

### affirmative nomadology

* concept of nomadism is really from Deleuze and Guattari
* explores some manifestations of nomadism \(science, music\)
* p. 24 concept of nomadism hinges on...
* p. 24 nomadism as a way of being: "nomadism thus designates forms of human activity where the social field remains a smooth space; where models and principles of social organization arise immanently from group activity itself, instead of being imposed by a transcendent instance from above; where itinerantfollowing of singularities and group creation prevails over the reproduction and/or imposition of preexisting forms and the issuing and obeying of commands."
* p. xxi, "the task of affirmative nomadology, and what makes it affirmative, is seeking out and highlighting actual instances of alternative, nonstate and noncapitalist forms of sociality..."
* then, the selected examples and the treatment of the problem suggest that this form of immanent organization \(self-organization\) is THE solution to the problem. but this raises a real question for me: how, or do, we know whether self-organization is the only alternative to state and capitalist forms of sociality?\* part of me wants to say that it is tautological. but it could be that it only seems tautological because we know of no other alternatives.

* p. 28 nomadology is a political philosophy

* p. 28 nomadology's "characteristic and proper activity..."

### death state

problem of the state -

* geneology of modes of social organization \(yet preclude 'linear evolutionism'\)
* "the founding of the state... necessarily entails an initial illegitimate use of force." ..."social contract theory thus stands exposed as a convenient fiction, a kind of screen narrative that projects the noti ons of social contract and consent of the governed retroactively onto the foundation of the state to mask its violence and illegitimacy." p. 35.
* "in an all importance sense... and cerainly in contrast with acephalous societies, all States are police states." p. 37
* "in general the modern state takes the main functions of acephalous leadership-- protection, mediation, and provision-- and makes them more or less permanent." p. 37-38.
* p. 39
* "the liberal-capitalist nation state reconfigures the basic elements of social organization." p. 40

\(this presentation is deeply compelling to me because i am sympathetic to it-- but it isn't very complete-- there is another side of this analysis which is all the good things these features/bugs can be said to have provided. of course, the real problem is not those features directly but it is the way these features create externalities which subvert the individual and implicit values  
around autonomy and agency. what is missing is a discussion of perhaps why this approach emerged as at least an_attempt_to address certain problems, rather than a characterization of it as being entirely machiavellian...\)

### consent in representative democracies

* "consent in representative democracies remains largely fictional" p. 35-36

### acephalous societies!!!

* clastres

### ideas about philosophy and construction of concepts

* philosophy vs. science

### chapter 2

the problem of the state  
viz acephalous societies  
the state reconfigures social behavior on particular ways  
the capitalist state moreso, recreates and imposes despotic power relations  
through the nuclear family and the corporation.  
capitalism creates perverse dynamics and pressures on the state, which reinfores these perversions of the underlying/fundamental/"pure"? \(implied\) acephalous relations.

when does politics emerge? is it because we are innate political animals?  
\(derrida, aristotle\), because of external threat \(schmitt\),

the origins of the state are by definition in illegitimate use of violence and power  
through which the state becomes formed  
and thus retroactively validates it.  
we also defer violence to the state - this is one of or social contracts  
and the state maintains its ability to enforce shared agreements through violence  
so in this way the state's cell membrane, boundary is really defined by violence.  
in this way all states \(as we know them\) are in some sense a police state.

death and violence are so important to the continuing viability of state rule  
as to warrant the term "death state."

then he talks for about 20 pages but on ?? he is fleshing out an argument but  
on what i am not sure. the ways in which capital affects and leads/dictates the  
state? and its crucial connection to the state's demands on life and of  
sacrifice.  
- is this schizoanalysis? the psychological implications of the metaphors and imagery used by the state  
and how they play off deep seated human psychology.

monopoly on violence, and_therefore_on citizenship  
nomadology is counter to this  
affrmative nomadology's task is to find a productive alternative

## nations, nation-state {#nationsnationstate}

# other {#other}

this book, others-- talk about the WHY - the philosophy behind the existence of nationalism, national identities, and _why _the dynamics of the state are changing, or _why _they _should _change.

how about the _what_- consider books on the why, like imagined communities \(origins of nationalism-- at least proposed\), commonwealth \(changing dynamics of the state, the nature of global regimes\), unrecognized states \(the way in which the regime of internationalism invalidates other forms of identity + governance\), nomad citizenship \(new conceptual lenses through which to think about emancipatory citizenship and governance\), a thousand years of non linear history \(TYNLH\) \(new materialist discussion of the dynamics underlying the trends and evolutions we see-- sort of a physics of social structure change. it is historic \(and therefore structuralist? not sure i know what this means\) in the sense that it examines changes in social dynamics over time, that is, leverages a temporal axis to "diagnose" how society generates \(manifests/presents with\) structure, and propose fundamental dynamics that are always at play underneath the material changes we see in society. but also talks about and very much recognizes discontinuities and nonlinearities\). 

these books argue for _why _we should expect to see certain dynamics, or _why _certain lenses on the world could change our ways of being, but what about the what-- what we do see happening now, and how it is a manifestation of these arguments. enspiral, EN, ouishare, zapitistas, rojava, faircoop... new and emerging forms of national identity which circumvent the state. why are they manifesting? \(because the traditional forms of nation-state are failing to meet the needs of citizens, because other forms of organizing are now possible due to technology and mobility,

rojava - failure of protests \(death\), alternative political project as a reaction to that, framed as an outflow of energy that needs_some_outlet? TYNLH? or other?  
state-endorsed forms of dissent are no longer cutting it - people are self-organizing around alternative means - sunflower movement in south korea... .
